# 1PP-controller

A simple 1st-person controller with [W][S][A][D] controls, [LShift] to acceleration, mouse camera control and ability to jump via [Space]

Jump ability works only with the ground objects that have Layer ID equal 6 (need to create new layer in inspector with ID: 6 and name it Ground)
